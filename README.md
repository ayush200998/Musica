# Automatic Music Generation Using Deep-Learning

## Introduction
Our task here is to take some existing music data then train a model using this existing data. The model has to learn the patterns in music that we humans enjoy. Once it learns this, the model should be able to generate new music for us. It cannot simply copy-paste from the training data. It has to understand the patterns of music to generate new music. We here are not expecting our model to generate new music which is of professional quality, but we want it to generate a decent quality music which should be melodious and good to hear.
